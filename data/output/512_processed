"""
You are given a list of N people who are attending ACM-ICPC World Finals. Each of them are either well versed in a topic
or they are not. Find out the maximum number of topics a 2-person team can know. And also find out how many teams can
know that maximum number of topics.

Input Format

The first line contains two integers N and M separated by a single space, where N represents the number of people, and M
 represents the number of topics. N lines follow.
Each line contains a binary string of length M. In this string, 1 indicates that the ith person knows a particular
topic, and 0 indicates that the ith person does not know the topic. Here, 1 <= i <= 2, and it denotes one of the persons
in the team
