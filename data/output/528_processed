"""
Given a unsorted array with integers, find the median of it.

A median is the middle number of the array after it is sorted.

If there are even numbers in the array, return the N/2-th number after sorted.

Example
Given [4, 5, 1, 2, 3], return 3

Given [7, 9, 4, 5], return 5

Challenge
O(n) time.
