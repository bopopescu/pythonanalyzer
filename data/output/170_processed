    method object itself (which is normally a transient
    object) is kept alive.  Instead, the BoundMethodWeakref
    object keeps weak references to both the object and the
    function which together define the instance method.

        key -- the identity key for the reference, calculated
            by the class's calculateKey method applied to the
            target instance method
        deletionMethods -- sequence of callable objects taking

            target function is garbage collected (i.e. when
